#This file contains the instructions to set up Ansible on a local workstation.
#It looks like a shell script, but it should not be executed as one.
#Instead, this instructions's commands shall be run manually,
#  in a Linux terminal of the operator's workstation,
#  verifying the output and applying common sense in every moment.
This file's porpouse is to serve as a reference for the operator,
#  in order to help him to set up the needed environment smoothly,
#  in a reproduceable fashion
#  and be easy to modify in case the requirements or the procedures
#    changes slightly.

#Ideally, this file shall be modified as the project develops
#  and stored in a verison control system, such as GIT.


#Use portable version instead?

#Seems not to work well with the collections.
#  It can install and list them,
#  but can't find them if referenced from a playbook.
