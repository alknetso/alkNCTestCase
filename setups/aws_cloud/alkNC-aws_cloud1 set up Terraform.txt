#This file contains the instructions to set up Terraform on a local workstation.
#It looks like a shell script, but it should not be executed as one.
#Instead, this commands shall be executed manually
#  in a Linux terminal of the operator's workstation,
#  at most with aid of a copy-paste,
#  verifying the output and applying common sense in every moment.

#This file's porpouse is to serve as a reference for the operator,
#  in order to help him to set up the needed environment
#    smoothly and in a reproduceable fashion.
#It also allows to modify the environment setup easily
#  in case the requirements or procedures changes slightly.

#Ideally, this file shall be modified as the project develops,
#  reflecting all the changes
#  and stored in a verison control system, such as GIT.

#Beside serving as project's live documentation,
#  the ultimate goal of this file is to allow to re-create the project from 0
#  at any time.


####
# Set up Terraform infrastructure on SysAdmin's workstation

#CD to the project base directory before you continue. Let's say
mkdir -p ~/NCTestCase
cd ~/NCTestCase

#Will use this directory to store executable files and tools
#  used pro the project's infrastructure management.
mkdir -p exec
cd exec

#Download the Terraform binary distribution
#Check https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html first
